# About

Hi, I'm Kevin from Pennington, NJ.  
I'm a high school junior passionate about machine learning, data science, statistics, and building AI that solves real problems.

## Current Focus
- Deepening time series forecasting & NLP
- Mastering model interpretability & deployment

## Toolkit
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL basics
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (early stage)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

## Philosophy
I learn best by building experiments. Each run — success or spectacular failure — teaches something valuable about how data tells stories.

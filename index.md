# Kevin

Hi, I'm Kevin from Pennington, NJ.  
Innovating through AI, Data Science, Machine Learning & Statistics.

I'm a high school junior passionate about turning raw data into real decisions and building models that solve meaningful problems.

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic learner with a strong foundation in:
- Machine learning algorithms & model building
- Data analysis & visualization
- Python programming & software development basics

I love tackling complex questions, cleaning messy datasets, and seeing how small changes in features or hyperparameters can dramatically improve results.

## My Experiments (Work in Progress)

### Featured / Recent Work
- **Project 1** — [Brief description — e.g., Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data]  
  Used NLP + classification models to detect emotion in text. Achieved XX% accuracy after feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Project 2** — [Brief description — e.g., Boston Housing Price Prediction]  
  Classic regression problem with heavy emphasis on data cleaning, outlier handling, and model comparison (Linear Regression vs. Random Forest vs. XGBoost).

More experiments coming soon — check the [Experiments](/experiments/) page for details, code, notebooks, and live demos!

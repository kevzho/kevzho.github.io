Hi, I'm Kevin from Pennington, NJ. I'm a high school junior passionate about machine learning, data science, statistics, and building AI that solves real problems.

🔬 **Currently exploring**: [Your current big project — e.g., Time Series Forecasting or Sentiment Analysis Tool]  
📚 **Just completed**: Veritas AI Fellowship  
📈 **Learning path so far**: Statistics → Scikit-learn basics → TensorFlow/PyTorch intro

"I believe the best way to learn is by running experiments — even the failures teach something valuable."
